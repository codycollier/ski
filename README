Ski is a simple text based game

A number of years ago, the code for a variation of this game was published in an apple basic magazine.  We eagerly typed it in and played the game for hours on an apple IIgs.  I've never found the original code or references to the game online.  So, this small python script attempts to recreate that game.


keys:
  * j - move to the left
  * k - move to the right


example:

!                 H              !
  !              H                 !
   !            H                   !
   !           H                    !
    !           H                    !
     !          H                     !
    !           H                    !

Update:
I found the program, or one very similar in a programming magazine called "Family Computing Magazine 1985 Special" by Joey Latimer and the Family Computing Techinical Staff.  The program is called "Ski Trek" and is available in several flavors of Basic.  The whole magaizine is available at archive.org:
